# DLND-P2-image-classification
Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## About
In this project, I've classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The images are preprocessed, then a convolutional neural network is trained on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. Finally, I've build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, the neural network's predictions are evaluated on the sample images.

The full code is in this [Python notebook](dlnd_image_classification.ipynb).
